# Website Time Tracker Backend

Simple FastAPI server to receive notifications when website time limits are reached.

## Setup

1. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the server:
```bash
python main.py
```

Or using uvicorn directly:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8000`
